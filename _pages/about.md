I am a third year PhD student at Brown University advised by Ellie Pavlick and Carsten Eickhoff. My research is on representation learning for grounded language and multimodal models. I am interested in understanding the processes such models use to make predictions, how representations of language-only models differ from those of models trained on other modalities (images, 3D objects), and the kinds of structure that can be learned from unstructured data. More broadly, I am interested in interpretability of neural networks, commonsense reasoning, and language acquisition in humans. Before joining Brown, I received my BS in computer science at UMass Amherst, where I worked with Mohit Iyyer and Brendan O'Connor on NLP and computational social science problems.

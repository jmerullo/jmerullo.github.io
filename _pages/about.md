I am a third year PhD student at Brown University advised by Ellie Pavlick and Carsten Eickhoff. My research is on representation learning for grounded language and multimodal models. I am interseted in understanding what language models can learn about the non-linguistic world from training only on text, how these representations differ from neural models trained on other modalities (images, 3D objects), and how we can train language models that "understand" the world the way humans do. More broadly, I an interested in interpretability of neural networks and commonsense reasoning. Before joining Brown, I received my BS in computer science from UMass Amherst, where I worked with Mohit Iyyer and Brendan O'Connor on aresa in NLP and computational social science.

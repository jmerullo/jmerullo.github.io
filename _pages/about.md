I am a third year PhD student at Brown University advised by Ellie Pavlick and Carsten Eickhoff. My research is on representation learning for grounded language and multimodal models. I am interested in understanding if language models can learn about the non-linguistic world from training on text-only data, how these representations differ from those of neural models trained on other modalities (images, 3D objects), and how we can train grounded models that "understand" the world the way humans do. More broadly, I am interested in interpretability of neural networks and commonsense reasoning. Before joining Brown, I received my BS in computer science at UMass Amherst, where I worked with Mohit Iyyer and Brendan O'Connor on NLP and computational social science problems.

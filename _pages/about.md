I am a fourth year PhD student at Brown University advised by Ellie Pavlick and Carsten Eickhoff. My research is on interpreting the processes language models use to make predictions, the kinds of structure that can be learned from self-supervised learning, and how multimodal models differ from those trained on text. My current focus is using and developing tools in mechanistic interpretability to shed light on how language models perform complex behaviors. Before joining Brown, I received my BS in computer science at UMass Amherst, where I worked with Mohit Iyyer and Brendan O'Connor on NLP and computational social science problems.
